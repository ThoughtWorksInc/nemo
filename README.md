# Welcome to the Nemo project

This is the entry point for the Nemo project. Here you are only going to find instructions on how to obtain access to the project. This repository was made public to ease our internal onboarding process. However, it is intended to be accessed and used only by [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com) employees.

## What is Nemo?

At ThoughtWorks we often receive thousands of job applications every month in each one of the 12 countries and 37 offices we operate (the list keeps growing). Going through each of these job applications is a laborous process and consumes an increbile amount of time from our recruiters.

Nemo is a platform that aims to improve our recruitment pipeline by prioritizing the candidates that have the highest potential to get hired. It does so by using some very clever algorithms and heuristics to best match a candidate profile with our culture and expectations. Also, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning is planed in the future. 

Please keep in mind that no candidate is ever discarded by Nemo, the only thing Nemo computes is a priority index so candidates with more potential are interviewed and hired first.

## Obtaining access to the repositories

In order to access the repositories, you should meet the following criteria:

- Be a ThoughtWorks employee.
- Have a free [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account (can be your personal one, it doesn't need to be registered with a ThoughtWorks e-mail).

Once you qualify, then:

1. Send an e-mail to techops-support@thoughtworks.com from your ThoughtWorks e-mail account, requesting your GitHub username be included in the [ThoughtWorksInc](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc) organization on GitHub (don't forget to let them know your username). This is a simple process and it should take no more than a day.
2. As soon as you are a member of ThoughtWorksInc, then look for the [Nemo team](https://github.com/orgs/ThoughtWorksInc/teams/nemo) and ask any member from the list to include you in the team. All team members are administrators, so they can add anyone.

**THIS IS IMPORTANT:** Please make sure that you have been added as a member of the ThoughtWorksInc organization and then as a member of the Nemo team. Once you have, then you will automatically have access to all existing repositories and new ones. If you are just manually added to specific repositories life is going to be more difficult for you and you will spoil the fun :D

## Project onboarding

Now that you are a member of the Nemo team, go ahead and access the [nemo-onboarding](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/nemo-onboarding) repository for:

- Project overview
- Architecture overview
- List of tools we use as a team, and how to obtain access to them
- List of all repositories (you should be able to access them now)

And remember: [DON'T PANIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don.27t_Panic)!

## Why not include onboarding information here?

Because this is a public repository and the Nemo project contains confidential information. We are not ready to expose it to the public yet. Maybe in the future it could be disclosed as open-source.

Also, part of the onboarding process requires listing tools, accounts and e-mails we use. Exposing this information here would be a security and privacy liability.

This is a meta repository, therefore code should *never* be commited here.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
