# Welcome to the Nemo project

This is the entry point for the Nemo project. Here we list all the repositories and tools we use, and how to obtain access to them. This is a meta repository, therefore code should *never* be commited here.

This repository was made public to ease our internal onboarding process. However, it is intended to be accessed and used only by [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com) employees.

**Please do not commit any confidential information here**

## Obtaining access to the repositories

In order to access the repositories, you should meet the following criteria:

- Be a [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com) employee.
- Have a free [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account (can be your personal one, it doesn't need to be registered with a ThoughtWorks e-mail).

Once you qualify, then:

1. Send an e-mail to techops-support@thoughtworks.com from your ThoughtWorks e-mail account, requesting your GitHub username be included in the [ThoughtWorksInc](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc) organization on GitHub. This is a simple process and it should take not more than a day. _It is very important that you are included as a member of the ThoughtWorksInc organization, and not just added to specific repositories_.
2. As soon as you are a member of @ThoughtWorksInc, then look for the [Nemo team](https://github.com/orgs/ThoughtWorksInc/teams/nemo) and ask any team member from the list to include you in the team. All team members are administrators, so they can add anyone. _It is very important that you are included as a member of the Nemo team, and not just added to specific repositories_.

If you have problems, please reach Nayara Moura (nmoura@thoughtworks.com) or Gregório Melo (gmelo@thoughtworks.com).
