# Welcome to the Nemo project

This is the entry point for the Nemo project. Here you are only going to find instructions on how to obtain access to the project. This repository was made public to ease our internal onboarding process. However, it is intended to be accessed and used only by [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com) employees.

This is a meta repository, therefore code should *never* be commited here. Also, please do not disclose any information that should not be made public.

## Obtaining access to the repositories

In order to access the repositories, you should meet the following criteria:

- Be a [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com) employee.
- Have a free [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account (can be your personal one, it doesn't need to be registered with a ThoughtWorks e-mail).

Once you qualify, then:

1. Send an e-mail to techops-support@thoughtworks.com from your ThoughtWorks e-mail account, requesting your GitHub username be included in the [ThoughtWorksInc](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc) organization on GitHub. This is a simple process and it should take no more than a day. _It is very important that you are included as a member of the ThoughtWorksInc organization, and not just added to specific repositories_.
2. As soon as you are a member of ThoughtWorksInc, then look for the [Nemo team](https://github.com/orgs/ThoughtWorksInc/teams/nemo) and ask any team member from the list to include you in the team. All team members are administrators, so they can add anyone. _It is very important that you are included as a member of the Nemo team, and not just added to specific repositories_.

## Project onboarding

Now that you are a member of the Nemo team, go ahead and access the [nemo-onboarding](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/nemo-onboarding) repository for:

- Project overview
- Architecture overview
- List of tools we use as a team, and how to obtain access to them
- List of all repositories (you should be able to access them now)

And remember: [DON'T PANIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don.27t_Panic)!

## Why not include onboarding information here?

Because this is a public repository and the Nemo project contains confidential information. We are not ready to expose it to the public yet. Maybe in the future it could be disclosed as open-source.

Sorry for any inconvenience.
